English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP) Tutorial Service (2025-2026) 

The English for Research Publication Purposes tutorial service (ERPP) is available at the Language Centre for UGC-funded postgraduate research students only. This service is offered on a first-come, first-served basis and is subject to the availability of the tutor at the chosen time requested by the student. Each UGC-funded postgraduate research student is eligible for 8 one-hour consultations per year. 

The manuscripts will be kept in strict confidence and accessed by the Language Centre (LC) staff for internal training and record-keeping purposes. The assistance of the LC tutors should be recognized in the Acknowledgement section of the published manuscripts. 

The Language Centre is also recruiting paid student assistants to serve as peer tutors to co-host workshops and tutorial sessions for fellow research students. Such workshops and tutorial services will be offered in partnership with Generative AI. Please indicate your interest in such opportunities in Q.6.

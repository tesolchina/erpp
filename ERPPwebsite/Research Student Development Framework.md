Introduction

Launched in academic year 2025/26, the Research Student Development Framework (the Framework) was developed under the direction of the Task Force on Research Student Development Framework (TF), comprising representatives from each faculty and school.

The Framework aims to elevate the research learning experience of research postgraduate (RPg) students and is guided by key principles: it adopts a holistic approach to research training, addresses both theoretical and practical aspects of research, and fosters personal and professional development.


 

 

About the Framework

Each training opportunity within the Framework is standalone, enabling students to participate at their own pace according to their individual needs and interests. It draws on HKBU’s in-house expertise, stakeholder input, and international best practices to provide a wide range of development opportunities. The activities and programmes offered by different units are organised under the following five themes:

Candidature Essentials:  Navigate the research journey, develop academic literacy and numeracy, work effectively with supervisors, and engage in self-reflection.

Research Governance and Environment:  Demonstrate professional conduct, uphold research integrity and ethics, ensure health and safety, maintain well-being, and manage research funding and resources.

Research Knowledge and Skills: Expand subject expertise, acquire skills in seeking and managing information, build digital capabilities, think critically and creatively, and master research methodologies.

Communication and Impact: Enhance teaching, publishing, presenting, and public engagement skills, alongside understand research impact, innovation, and commercialisation.

Collaboration, Leadership, and Career Development: Gain access to collaborative projects, work placements, and networking, combined with training in leadership, interpersonal communication, teamwork, and career planning.

Students may sign up according to the timeline of each individual module, and the certificate will show an accumulative record of their achievements.
Students are required to complete each course or activity within the specified academic year.

we'll have a similar website -to /workspaces/erpp/researchTeamWebsite
but ours will be simpler 

ERPP stands for English for Research Publication Purposes 

As you may already know, the ERPP has been integrated into the new Research Student Development Framework this year: Research Student Development Framework. The Graduate School has requested regular reports on the number of RPg students utilising this service. Last week, they asked for enrolment numbers for all LC workshops and services offered to RPgs. I learned from Charlene that, so far, no students have officially enroled in ERPP this semester. Please kindly think about how to enhance our promotion of ERPP. 


/workspaces/erpp/ERPPwebsite/Research Student Development Framework.md

the programme has been operating for about 7 years 
but recent years witnessed a decline in demand 
we plan to revitalize it 

the new focus will be on leveraging Large Language Model and to promote human-AI communication in the context of research writing 
some of the highlights of the workshops and services 
- students learn to use AI agents to communicate with AI in the context of their research project 
- even though the tasks are about writing or text-based, we think and work like a programmer 
- our approach is informed by genre theory and data-driven language learning 
- we leverage corpus linguistics and Generative AI for qualitative data analysis 


let's brainstorm a bit about the website structure 

- overview of the programme with some highlights and the info of the programme coordinator 
- registration details (can we embed the form )https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=IKmc7T5UBUOaZNYjlxbvu9wqq_BmZ7NEi6jig-YKo1FUQTVHWjZWQ0kxVUdPSDhVUDA1WEsyVzEyRy4u&route=shorturl 
- workshop info 
- practical skills on using AI and edtech (blog entries) 
- sharing of peer tutors and research student tutees (testimonies of research supervisors)

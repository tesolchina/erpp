# Notes on Li & Flowerdew (2020): Teaching ERPP - A Review

## Citation
Li, Y., & Flowerdew, J. (2020). Teaching English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP): A review of language teachers' pedagogical initiatives. *English for Specific Purposes*, 59, 29-41.

## Summary

This comprehensive review examines 31 articles describing **English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP)** instructional programs led by language teachers worldwide. The paper addresses the growing pressure on academics and research students globally to publish in high-ranking English-medium international journals, while recognizing that ERPP pedagogical support is crucial for English as an Additional Language (EAL) scholars.

### Key Findings

**Geographical Distribution**: The review covers diverse contexts across:
- Latin America (7), Europe (6), Asia (6), United States (5)
- Australia (3), Russia (2), Middle East (1), North Africa (1)
- Growing output over time, with 20 of 31 papers published from 2014 onwards

**Seven Organizational Categories Identified**:

1. **Rationales and Local Contexts**
   - Publication pressure for graduation, promotion, tenure
   - Gap between institutional requirements and absence of ERPP instruction
   - Language teachers often invited by content specialists or administrative support

2. **Theoretical Underpinnings**
   - ESP genre pedagogy (Swales, 1990) as dominant approach
   - Australian genre theory (Cope & Kalantzis, 1993) sometimes incorporated
   - Critical-pragmatic approaches addressing political issues of publishing in English
   - Other frameworks: immersion theory, community of practice model, self-regulated learning

3. **Pedagogical Approaches**
   - Typically organized around IMRaD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion)
   - Task-based with published empirical RAs as teaching materials
   - Sequences vary: chronological order, difficulty order, or composition order
   - Use of corpus-based approaches and genre analysis tasks

4. **Writing Tasks**
   - Four scenarios identified:
     a) Related texts but not complete RA (abstracts, conference papers)
     b) Preparation for future RA writing (definitional work, data commentary)
     c) Revision of existing drafts brought to course
     d) Progressive drafting from own research data during course

5. **Instructor and Peer Feedback**
   - Extensive teacher feedback during class and on assignments
   - Proofreading support in some contexts
   - Peer feedback emphasized with reference to 'community'
   - Collaborative proofreading and peer assessment

6. **Language Focus**
   - Genre-based approach linking lexico-grammar to rhetorical function
   - Discipline-specific to varying degrees
   - Sentence-level linguistic strategies for expressing meanings
   - Use of concordancing tools, corpus exploration, and online resources

7. **Specialised vs Specialist Knowledge**
   - ERPP teachers drawing on their research/publication experience
   - Some with content expertise from disciplinary backgrounds
   - Ferguson's (1997) distinction: specialised knowledge (discourse expertise) vs specialist knowledge (content expertise)

### Challenges Addressed

- **Participant diversity** (disciplines, genres, experience levels)
- **Teachers' lack of content knowledge** - addressed through:
  - Content-language specialist partnerships
  - Positive framing of diversity as advantage
  - Emphasis on specialised rather than specialist knowledge
- **Limited instruction time** - tackled through:
  - Fostering learner autonomy via genre analysis skills
  - Corpus building and exploration
  - Self-monitoring and proactive peer feedback engagement
- **English proficiency levels** of participants
- **Availability of research data** for writing tasks

## Pedagogical Activities Identified

### 1. Genre Analysis Activities
- Deconstructing published RAs from participants' fields
- Analyzing IMRaD structure and rhetorical moves
- Identifying language/discourse features in exemplar texts
- Building and exploring class corpora of student-contributed papers
- Comparing disciplinary variations in genre features

### 2. Corpus-Based Activities
- Using concordancing tools to explore linguistic patterns
- Creating mini-corpora from published articles
- Deriving sentence templates from published texts
- Exploring lexical bundles and collocations
- Introduction to tools like the Manchester Academic Phrase Bank

### 3. Writing Tasks (Progressive)
- **Section-by-section composition**: Methods → Results → Abstract → Introduction → Discussion
- **Proxy writing tasks**: Designing questionnaires, conducting surveys, writing up findings
- **Revision tasks**: Bringing manuscripts for improvement during course
- **Scaffolded writing**: Starting with definitions, data commentary, process descriptions

### 4. Feedback Activities
- **Instructor feedback**: On content, organization, language, discourse
- **Peer review**: Using rubrics for core components
- **Collaborative proofreading**: Group correction sessions
- **Individual consultations**: One-on-one guidance on drafts

### 5. Rhetorical Consciousness-Raising
- Four-stage cycle (Feak & Swales, 2010):
  - Analysis: Examining published texts
  - Awareness: Recognizing patterns and conventions
  - Acquisition: Practicing identified features
  - Achievement: Applying in own writing

### 6. Language-Focused Activities
- Teaching citation forms (author-prominent vs. information-prominent)
- Practicing verb tenses and tense shifts
- Understanding information structure (given-new)
- Exploring first-person vs. impersonal usage
- Working with controlled language principles
- Using templates and boilerplate text

### 7. Critical-Pragmatic Activities
- Discussing language choice for publication (English vs. L1)
- Exploring issues of epistemic erasure
- Examining career implications of language decisions
- Questioning standard vs. non-standard English
- Analyzing power dynamics in academic publishing

### 8. Publication Process Activities
- Selecting appropriate publication venues
- Understanding impact factors and predatory journals
- Working with gatekeepers (reviewers, editors)
- Dealing with language brokers and editing services
- Understanding publishing ethics and plagiarism
- Maximizing article impact post-publication

### 9. Research Methodology Integration
- Discussion of theoretical frameworks (especially social sciences)
- Exploring research design and methodology
- Understanding research rigour through a Research Writing Matrix
- Linking methodology to writing choices

### 10. Community-Building Activities
- Writing support groups
- Discussion forums where participants learn from each other
- Peer assessment and collaboration
- Interdisciplinary exchange of perspectives

## Implications for ERPP Course Design

### Recommendations
1. **Balance specialised and specialist knowledge** - focus on discourse expertise while collaborating with content specialists when possible
2. **Promote learner autonomy** through genre analysis skills and corpus tools
3. **Address diversity positively** - use mixed disciplines as learning resource
4. **Integrate critical awareness** of publication politics, especially for HSS contexts
5. **Include non-discursive practices**: journal selection, ethics, working with editors/reviewers
6. **Provide extensive feedback opportunities** from both instructors and peers
7. **Scaffold writing tasks** according to participants' preparedness and proficiency

### Areas Needing Development
- More attention to "non-discursive" publication practices
- English as Lingua Franca (ELF) vs. Standard English discussion
- ERPP teacher training and professional development
- Provision for English L1 speakers who also need ERPP support
- Integration of team writing practices
- Addressing stigma associated with needing English support

## Conclusion

The review demonstrates that while ERPP provision is growing globally, it remains underdeveloped relative to demand. The field shows considerable commonality in approaches (genre-based pedagogy, IMRaD focus, corpus use) but also creative diversity in addressing local contexts and constraints. The synthesis provides a valuable repository of pedagogical strategies for ERPP practitioners, course designers, and curriculum planners.

## Notes for Workshop Application
- Genre-based approaches work across diverse disciplinary contexts
- Balance explicit instruction with fostering autonomy
- Critical-pragmatic dimension especially important for non-Anglophone contexts
- Peer feedback and community building enhance learning
- Integration of language, genre, and publication process knowledge essential

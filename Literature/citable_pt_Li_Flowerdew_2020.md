## Key Point 1: Study Scope and Research Question

### **Finding**
This paper surveys existing reported ERPP pedagogical practices led by language teachers, analyzing 31 articles to understand contexts and pedagogical strategies.

### **Direct Excerpt**
> "This paper surveys existing reported ERPP pedagogical practices, aiming to answer the research question 'What does the literature tell us about the contexts and pedagogical strategies of ERPP instruction led by language teachers?' A selection of 31 articles was retrieved as the focal literature and seven categories of meaning were derived: rationales and local contexts, theoretical underpinnings and pedagogical approaches, writing tasks, instructor and peer feedback, language focus, challenging issues, and specialised vs. specialist knowledge." (Abstract)

### **Research Context**
> "Academics and research students around the world have increasingly come under pressure to publish in high-ranking English-medium international journals. At the same time, it has been widely recognised that English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP) pedagogical support can be crucial to the publication success of those scholars and students who use English as an Additional Language (EAL)." (Abstract)

## Key Point 2: Seven Categories of ERPP Pedagogical Practices

### **Finding**
The review identified seven key categories that characterize ERPP instruction led by language teachers.

### **Direct Excerpt**
> "Seven categories of meaning were derived: rationales and local contexts, theoretical underpinnings and pedagogical approaches, writing tasks, instructor and peer feedback, language focus, challenging issues, and specialised vs. specialist knowledge." (Abstract)

### **Categories Identified**:
1. **Rationales and local contexts**
2. **Theoretical underpinnings and pedagogical approaches**
3. **Writing tasks**
4. **Instructor and peer feedback**
5. **Language focus**
6. **Challenging issues**
7. **Specialised vs. specialist knowledge**

---

## Key Point 3: Genre-Based Pedagogical Approach

### **Finding**
ERPP instruction is typically organized around the IMRaD structure and employs genre-based pedagogy.

### **Direct Excerpt**
> "The theoretical underpinnings of the ERPP interventions are reflected in their course objectives and pedagogical content. ESP genre pedagogy and sometimes Australian genre theory may be drawn upon for the course design." (p. 167)

> "Firstly, the teaching is typically organised around the IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) structure of an empirical RA. The presentation/practice/production teaching format might be applied in the sequential order of the typical RA." (p. 169)

### **Additional Evidence**
> "Secondly, a genre-based ERPP course is likely to be task-based, with published empirical RAs typically constituting an important source of teaching/learning material." (p. 171)

---

## Key Point 4: Three Scenarios of Writing Tasks

### **Finding**
The review identified three distinct scenarios for writing tasks in ERPP courses.

### **Direct Excerpt**
> "Given that the pedagogical goal of the programmes under review is to assist participants in writing for publication, attention needs to be paid to the characteristics of the writing tasks assigned during the various interventions described in our focal literature. A range of scenarios can be identified." (p. 181)

### **Three Scenarios**:

#### **Scenario 1: Related Texts, Not Full RAs**
> "In a first scenario, participants may be required to produce related texts, but not the RA itself." (p. 183)

#### **Scenario 2: Preparation for Future RA Writing**
> "The second scenario might be described as preparing course participants to write an RA in the future (rather than actually writing an RA itself in the course)." (p. 185)

#### **Scenario 3: Revision of Existing Drafts**
> "In a third scenario, the course participants may be expected to already have a draft of an RA upon enrolling in the writing programme, a draft they would revise during the course." (p. 187)

## Key Point 5: Importance of Instructor and Peer Feedback

### **Finding**
Both instructor and peer feedback are crucial components of ERPP pedagogical programs.

### **Direct Excerpt**
> "Availability of teacher feedback, both during class writing time and on written assignments, is a noticeable feature of the pedagogical programmes that included writing tasks." (p. 195)

### **Instructor Feedback**
> "In Aranha's (2009) class with dentistry students, after an assessment of the students' linguistic readiness to write, students were given writing assignments from Week 3 onwards. Initial definition of the field of study was followed by the writing of Methods, Results, Abstract, and finally Introduction. Relevant instruction prepared the students to write the individual sections and the students' texts were discussed in class and through individual consultations with the instructor." (p. 195)

### **Peer Feedback**
> "Apart from instructor feedback, peer feedback is also emphasised in our focal literature. When relating implementations of peer feedback, a number of publications make reference to the notion of 'community', as embodied in the theoretical underpinnings of the featured pedagogical interventions." (p. 199)

---

## Key Point 6: Proofreading Support in ERPP Programs

### **Finding**
Some ERPP programs include proofreading support as part of their pedagogical approach.

### **Direct Excerpt**
> "Related to instructor feedback is proofreading support, available in two Russian programmes. In the former programme, apart from local instructors, the teaching team included a native-English-speaker instructor who proofread the participants' manuscript drafts between Part 1 and Part 2 of the course and at the end of the course (in addition to peer correction, to be noted below)." (p. 197)

---

## Key Point 7: Field-Specific Nature of ERPP

### **Finding**
ERPP instruction must balance specialized knowledge with general academic writing skills.

### **Direct Excerpt**
> "The seventh category, 'specialised vs. specialist knowledge', addresses the question of how much discipline-specific knowledge ERPP instructors need to have and how much they can rely on general academic writing skills." (p. 272)

---

## Key Point 8: Underdeveloped Field Despite Growing Demand

### **Finding**
Despite increasing demand for ERPP support, the field remains underdeveloped.

### **Direct Excerpt**
> "In view of the huge demand for ERPP intervention, the field can still be considered as underdeveloped. By synthesising the relevant literature to date, this review is timely and will be of value to course designers and ERPP practitioners present and future." (Abstract)

### **Historical Context**
> "Further published reports of pedagogical ERPP interventions only started to appear, however, in the early 2000s. Since then, such reports have been gradually increasing, to such a point that a review of such literature to date, synthesising existing reported practices, is now timely." (p. 61)

---

## Key Point 9: Selection Criteria and Methodology

### **Finding**
The review used specific inclusion criteria to focus on language teacher-led ERPP interventions.

### **Direct Excerpt**
> "Our target literature consists of reports that feature ERPP instruction led by language instructors (as opposed to content teachers or journal editors) aimed at (post)graduate students or academics of any discipline." (p. 69)

### **Inclusion Criteria**
> "a selected article must describe some form of ERPP instruction (in the form of a course or a series of workshops or seminars); if the focus is on an empirical study, details of the programme/teaching process are nevertheless provided

> the focus of the instruction featured must be on the genre of the RA and sometimes also on the publication process;

> the instructor(s) must have had an explicitly stated or implied goal of facilitating the participants' research writing for publication skills;

> and the pedagogical interventions must be led by a language teacher or language teachers (typically EAP/ERPP specialists) as opposed to by content specialists" (p. 71-85)

## Key Point 10: Practical Value for ERPP Practitioners

### **Finding**
This review provides practical guidance for current and future ERPP course designers and practitioners.

### **Direct Excerpt**
> "By synthesising the relevant literature to date, this review is timely and will be of value to course designers and ERPP practitioners present and future." (Abstract)

### **Research Purpose**
> "In the present paper, therefore, we present such a review, focusing on the instructional initiatives undertaken by language teachers who typically work with EAL students or academics who wish to or need to publish. Such a review is likely to be of value to course designers and teachers of ERPP courses in the future." (p. 61)
